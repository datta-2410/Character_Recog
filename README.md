## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Frontend Setup
Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project-repo.git
   cd project-repo/frontend
   See Frontend Readme for more details

 ###  Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:
   cd ../backend
Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install backend dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the Flask API:
   flask run

   ###  Machine Learning Model Setup:
   Navigate to the data-science directory:
      cd ../data-science
   Install required libraries:
      pip install -r requirements.txt
   Train the model 
   ### **Usage**
   - **Frontend:** Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the React application.
   - **Backend:** The Flask API runs on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You can test it using tools like Postman.
   - **Machine Learning:** The pre-trained model is used to predict handwritten digits and convert notes.
